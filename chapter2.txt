The second chapter has 2 options: 
It either supports the story of chapter 1 if left unfinished in chapter 1 or starts a new story in line with the previous chapter to better define the characters.
It can also introduce new characters at the same time. 
It can also have some unexpected twist which can or can't bring us to the main story line.
