This is chapter one. It usually introduces some or all(rarely all the characters are in the 1st chapter to create suspence) characters of the story. It can have a warm start or something like a scene from the middle cut or a mystery/thriller/sad start.
Usually either a character which has a good relation with the main character or a complete stranger is shown doing something to start the scene.
